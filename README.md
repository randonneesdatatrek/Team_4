* heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset
Our project exploits a sample of heart failure clinical records to predict heart failure mortality risks. Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of mortality worldwide and it represents 31% of all death around the world. So, as it said by Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman in their dataset's analysis: "Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure". For this reason, this study is irrefutably useful.
