## Hi all !
-	Iâ€™m currently working on a project about classification issues so, I want to predict heart failure mortality risks.
-	I'm currently learning SVM and neural network
Our project exploits a sample of heart failure clinical records to predict heart failure mortality risks.

## Abstract 

Our project exploits a sample of heart failure clinical records to predict heart failure mortality risks.
Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of mortality worldwide and it represents 31% of all death around the world. 
So, as it said by Davide Chicco, Giuseppe Jurman in their dataset's analysis: 
"Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure". For this reason, this study is irrefutably useful.
